### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    The targeted user in this project is Laura, a Public Health Analyst working for the Wisconsin Department of Health.  She is responsible for supporting strategic planning for health services across the entire state, especially in rural areas where healthcare access is       uneven.  She works on identifying emerging public health needs and evaluating demographic trends as they relate to service allocation, aging populations and long-term care infrastructure. 
    
    She holds a Master’s Degree in Public Health, but is not a GIS expert.  However, she regularly uses maps and data visualizations built by others in her organization to prepare reports for state and federal funding applications. 
    
    She will use the application to identify counties that have had high percentage growths of people over 65 years old, then using those trends and population pyramids of each county she will predict where those trends will continue in the coming years. 
    2. Scenario
       It is Monday morning, and Laura is preparing a proposal to request funding to expand healthcare services in Wisconsin counties, particularly in rural areas where there has been a high growth in elderly citizens. 

    She opens the “Aging America” interactive map in her browser.  The primary representation is a choropleth map of Wisconsin counties, shaded by the percentage of population over 65 based on the 2020 census.  She can select different decades back to 1970 if she wishes.      If she wants to see more clearly how the population above 65 has changed since 1970, she can toggle the map view to show the growth or shrinkage of population above 65 for each county since 1970. 
    
    She clicks on rural Vernon County.  A population pyramid appears on the right side of the screen, showing a bulge in 65+ age brackets in 2020.  She pins Vernon County to the top half of the right side, then selects urban Dane County, and compares the graphs.  Her         hypothesis is confirmed – rural counties have been aging at a faster rate than urban counties. 
    
    Then, she toggles the “Healthcare Facilities” layer – a point layer representation of hospitals and clinics.  She can see counties of high aging rates have few or no nearby facilities, suggesting a gap in service infrastructure.
