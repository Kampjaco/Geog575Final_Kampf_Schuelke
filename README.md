### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    The targeted user in this project is Laura, a Public Health Analyst working for the Wisconsin Department of Health.  She is responsible for supporting strategic planning for health services across the entire state, especially in rural areas where healthcare access is       uneven.  She works on identifying emerging public health needs and evaluating demographic trends as they relate to service allocation, aging populations and long-term care infrastructure. 
    
    She holds a Masterâ€™s Degree in Public Health, but is not a GIS expert.  However, she regularly uses maps and data visualizations built by others in her organization to prepare reports for state and federal funding applications. 
    
    She will use the application to identify counties that have had high percentage growths of people over 65 years old, then using those trends and population pyramids of each county she will predict where those trends will continue in the coming years.
